# Changing Patient through Unity

**Table of Contents**

[TOC]

## Requirements

### Unity Hub
[Download here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). The Unity Hub is a management tool that you can use to manage all of your Unity Projects and installations.

### Unity v2019.4.26f1
[Download here](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2019.4). On the linked website, expand LTS Release 2019.4.26f1, and click on Download (Win) or Download (Mac) based on the OS you use. Use the downloaded file to install Unity, and remember the installation location because we will need it later.

### Visual Studio
[Download the Community version here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). Visual Studio is a full-featured IDE to code, debug, test, and deploy to any platform. We will need it to build the application with the new patients loaded.

### Project Download
[Download the project folder here](https://github.com/daniCh8/mixed-reality-surgery-assistance-2020). Press on *Code*, select *Download ZIP*, and unzip the downloaded archive in your desired location.

You can create a new license by pressing on *Activate new license* and select *Unity Personal* as a License Agreement.

### Unity Location

We need to wire the Unity Version we installed with Unity Hub. To do so, open Unity Hub and go to Installs through the menu on the left.
